                <h1>Art Extravaganza Takes Over School Hallways</h1>
                <p>Last week, our hallways transformed into an art lover's paradise. The Art Club 
                    organized an incredible art extravaganza, featuring masterpieces from our talented 
                    student artists. Paintings, sculptures, and multimedia installations turned our 
                    school into a vibrant gallery. Boorelynn Knudsen showcased her newest edible sculpture,
                    "Dimensions of Promise," made entirely out of locally made Gouda. Needless to say it didn't last
                    long after the exibit finished! "Goudos" to the artists 
                    for sharing their creativity with us!</p>
